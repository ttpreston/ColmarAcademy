I felt the specifications of the wireframe created a site the looked different than the image in the wireframe. 
Example: The wireframe specifies 8px padding top and bottom for the "Start Here" button. 
This resulted in a very narrow looking button for me.

I created the site based on the parameters of the wireframe over how the site looked in the wireframe.

Also, I had trouble using the Chrome developer tools when viewing my "mobile" version. The tools wouldn't show it to me. It would refresh to "desktop" version. I could never view the "mobile" version. It makes me think something is wrong or incomplete with that code. However, I was able to change the window size to view it. Could you advise why that might be the case? Thanks!
