I felt the specifications of the wireframe created a site the looked different than the image in the wireframe. 
Example: The wireframe specifies 8px padding top and bottom for the "Start Here" button. 
This resulted in a very narrow looking button for me.

I created the site based on the parameters of the wireframe over how the site looked in the wireframe.
